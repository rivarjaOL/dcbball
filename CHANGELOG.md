## November 2025

### November 29, 2025
- **Project Organization:**
  - Cleaned up and reorganized the project files to remove outdated versions and unnecessary clutter
  - Streamlined the codebase for easier future maintenance

- **Automatic Deployment:**
  - Configured the website to automatically update whenever changes are made - no manual deployment steps required

- **Mobile Fix (Resolved):**
  - Fixed an issue where tapping the "Register Now" button on mobile phones (iPhone/Android) was incorrectly opening the navigation menu instead of the registration form
  - The registration buttons now work correctly on all devices

- **Printable Registration Form:**
  - Created a PDF version of the registration form (`DSC_HOOPS_Registration_Form.pdf`) for parents/guardians who prefer a paper form or need to share registration information offline
