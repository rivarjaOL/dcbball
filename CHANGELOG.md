# Project Changelog

## November 2025

### November 24, 2025
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - **Hero Logo:** Enhanced visibility by increasing the white glow opacity and blur radius behind the main logo in the hero section to correct low contrast edges.
  - **Navigation Logo:** Improved visibility by increasing the background opacity to near-solid white (90%) for the small logo in the navigation bar.
  - **Schedule Link:** Fixed the "Training Schedule" link in the "How to Get Started" section (Step 1) which was previously unclickable due to a decorative CSS overlay.
  - **Email Functionality:** Added a "Copy Email" component to the "Email to Schedule" section. This provides users with a manual copy button and text field as a fallback for the `mailto:` link, preventing issues with unconfigured default email clients.

### November 17, 2025
- **Backend/Integration:**
  - Connected a new client-built Google Form to the project.
  - Added Google Apps Script email notification functionality for form submissions to ensure immediate alerts when users register.
